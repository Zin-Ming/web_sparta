		<p class="page01_text_p">Achilles was the son of the Nereid Thetis and of Peleus, the king of the Myrmidons. Zeus and Poseidon had been rivals for the hand of Thetis until Prometheus, the fore-thinker, warned Zeus of a prophecy (originally uttered by Themis, goddess of divine law) that Thetis would bear a son greater than his father. For this reason, the two gods withdrew their pursuit, and had her wed Peleus.</p>
		
		<p class="page01_text_p">According to the Achilleid, written by Statius in the 1st century AD,  when Achilles was born Thetis tried to make him immortal by dipping him in the river Styx; however, he was left vulnerable at the part of the body by which she held him: his left heel</p>
		
		<p class="page01_text_p">Peleus entrusted Achilles to Chiron the Centaur, on Mount Pelion, to be reared. Thetis foretold that her son's fate was either to gain glory and die young, or to live a long but uneventful life in obscurity. Achilles chose the former, and decided to take part in the Trojan war. According to Homer, Achilles grew up in Phthia together with his companion Patroclus.</p>

		<h2 class="page02_text_h2">In the Trojan War</h2>
		
		<p class="page02_text_p">At the beginning of 《Iliad》, Achilles had an argument with Agamemnon, which began when Hecsinon snatched the female slave that Achilles had returned, and Achilles left the camp in anger and never fought again. The Greek army's war situation was good, Zeus gave the soldiers confidence, but never intended to teach them to truly win, to later, the Greek allies were defeated, and was once beaten back to shore. Even if Agamemnon asked Achilles for forgiveness, he remained unmoved.</p>
		
		<p class="page02_text_p">Achilles' cousin, Patroquelos, could not bear to see his soldiers killed and wounded, put on Achilles' armor, pretended to be his face to fight, the situation was once reversed, and finally he was killed by the Trojan master Prince Hector, which inspired Achilles' war.</p>
		
		<p class="page02_text_p">After the war he fought bravely, and finally Hector died under the Achilles gun, Hector's old father Priamus redeemed his son's body, and the story ended in Hector's funeral. The relationship between Achilles and PatRolos is a profound friendship in 《Iliad》.</p>

		<h2 class="page03_text_h2">Death</h2>
		
		<p class="page03_text_p">In other works, Achilles is eventually shot in the ankle with an arrow by Hector's brother, Prince Paris, at the direction of Apollo, the sun god, and the first Warrior of the Greeks dies. There is a saying that after he killed Hector, the atrocity of the body abuse caused the discontent of the gods, of course, it can be said that everything is fate.</p>
		
		<p class="page03_text_p">Legend has it that after Achilles's death, his armor became the focus of a battle among Greek heroes, which was seen as a sign of his succession to the first man. As a result, Odysseus finally defeated the warrior, Great Eas, with his speech, inheriting the artifacts made by the artisan god Herhuistos. Big Eas then went mad at the induction of the goddess Athena and eventually died of his own.</p>
		
		<p class="page03_text_p">His son, Nirofto Lemos, joined the Trojan War after Achilles' death and eventually killed King Priamus in the Trojan City.</p>
